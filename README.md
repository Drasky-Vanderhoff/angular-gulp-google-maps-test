##### Know Issue

Remember that is just a demo to show how to combine google maps and angular.

  + Markers won't mantain a new assigned position after being applied.
  + In some odd cases, the first marker that's being created will not be displayed. Be sure to be precise with the name of the place you want the maker to appear ( for example, there is a CÃ³rdoba that is in Spain).
